## Benefits
- A simple to use python wrapper for endpoints.-
- In about 10 minutes, you could be programmatically trading on one of the
largest Bitcoin exchanges in the *world*!
- Do not worry about handling the nuances of the API with easy-to-use methods
for every API endpoint.
- Gain an advantage in the market by getting under the hood of CB Adv to learn
what and who is behind every tick.

## Under Development
- Test Scripts
- Additional Functionality for the real-time order book
- MongoDB integration

## Getting Started
This README is documentation on the syntax of the python client presented in
this repository. See function docstrings for full syntax details.  
**This API attempts to present a clean interface to CB Advanced Trade, but in order to use it
to its full potential, you must familiarize yourself with the official CB Advanced Trade
[documentation](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/advanced-trade-api/docs).**

- You may manually install the project or use ```pip```:
```python
pip install cbadv (not yet added to PyPi)
#or
pip install git+git://github.com/kkuette/coinbaseadv-python.git
```

### Client

```python
import cbadv

API_KEY = ''
API_SECRET = ''

client = cbadv.Client(api_key=API_KEY, api_secret=API_SECRET)
```

or

```python
import json
import cbadv

client = cbadv.Client(**json.load(open('path/to/credentials.json')))
```

### Client Methods

All API endpoints are now Private. You must setup API access within your
[account settings](https://coinbase.com/settings/api).

### WebsocketClient

If you would like to receive real-time market updates, you must subscribe to the
[websocket feed](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/advanced-trade-api/docs/ws-overview).
Websockets are now available for Authenticated clients only. You must setup API
access within your [account settings](https://coinbase.com/settings/api).

#### Subscribe to a single product
```python
import cbadv

# You need to provide api key and secret others parameters are optional
wsClient = cbadv.WebsocketClient(api_key, secret_key, url="wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com",
                                products="BTC-USD",
                                channels=["ticker"])
# Do other stuff...
wsClient.close()
```

#### Subscribe to multiple products
```python
import cbadv
# You need to provide api key and secret others parameters are optional
wsClient = cbadv.WebsocketClient(api_key, secret_key, url="wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com",
                                products=["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"],
                                channels=["ticker"])
# Do other stuff...
wsClient.close()
```

### WebsocketClient Methods
The ```WebsocketClient``` subscribes in a separate thread upon initialization.
There are three methods which you could overwrite (before initialization) so it
can react to the data streaming in.  The current client is a template used for
illustration purposes only.

- onOpen - called once, *immediately before* the socket connection is made, this
is where you want to add initial parameters.
- onMessage - called once for every message that arrives and accepts one
argument that contains the message of dict type.
- on_close - called once after the websocket has been closed.
- close - call this method to close the websocket connection (do not overwrite).
```python
import cbadv, time
class myWebsocketClient(cbadv.WebsocketClient):
    def __init__(self, apit_key, secret_key):
        super().__init__(api_key, secret_key)

    def on_open(self):
        self.url = "wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com"
        self.products = ["LTC-USD"]
        self.message_count = 0
        print("Lets count the messages!")
    def on_message(self, msg):
        self.message_count += 1
        if 'price' in msg and 'type' in msg:
            print ("Message type:", msg["type"],
                   "\t@ {:.3f}".format(float(msg["price"])))
    def on_close(self):
        print("-- Goodbye! --")

api_key = ''
secret_key = ''

wsClient = myWebsocketClient(api_key, secret_key)
#wsClient = myWebsocketClient(**json.load(open('path/to/credentials.json'))) # load from file
wsClient.start()
print(wsClient.url, wsClient.products)
while (wsClient.message_count < 500):
    print ("\nmessage_count =", "{} \n".format(wsClient.message_count))
    time.sleep(1)
wsClient.close()
```
## Testing
A test suite is under development. Tests for the authenticated client require a 
set of sandbox API credentials. To provide them, rename 
`api_config.json.example` in the tests folder to `api_config.json` and edit the 
file accordingly. To run the tests, start in the project directory and run
```
python -m pytest
```

### Real-time OrderBook

The ```OrderBook``` subscribes to a websocket and keeps a real-time record of
the orderbook for the product_id input.  Please provide your feedback for future
improvements.

```python
import cbadv, time, json

API_KEY = ''
API_SECRET = ''

order_book = cbadv.OrderBooks(api_key, api_secret, product_id=['BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD'])
order_book.start()
time.sleep(10)
order_book.close()
```

### Testing
Unit tests are under development using the pytest framework. Contributions are 
welcome!

To run the full test suite, in the project 
directory run:
```bash
python -m pytest
```
